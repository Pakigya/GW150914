# LIGO Gravitational Wave Graph Code

This MATLAB code generates a graph of the data for the LIGO gravitational wave detection event GW150914 which occurred on September 14, 2015. The inspiration and data came from the [LIGO Open Science Center](https://losc.ligo.org/events/GW150914/). 

I used this data to create a [minimalist T-shirt design on Teespring](https://teespring.com/ligo-gravity-wave).
